One major problem in U.S. banks that Agentic AI combined with Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) can solve is:


---

🏦 “Automated Exception Resolution in Mortgage and Loan Document Processing”


---

🔍 The Problem:

U.S. banks and mortgage lenders process millions of loans annually, and a huge percentage of these transactions encounter document exceptions — missing signatures, mismatched data, outdated forms, unsigned disclosures, or non-compliance with agency (FHA, VA, Fannie Mae) requirements.

📊 Scale of the Issue:

20–30% of mortgage packets have at least one exception

Each exception leads to manual back-and-forth, delays in closing, and pipeline risk

Regulatory scrutiny from agencies like FHFA, CFPB, OCC is increasing

Exception handling teams spend hours per loan packet



---

🚨 Why This Is Critical:

Delays in funding or closing

Compliance violations (e.g., TRID timing rules)

Customer dissatisfaction and fallout

Audit risk due to unresolved or hidden issues

✅ What Agentic AI Can Do Differently

Agentic AI doesn't just extract data — it thinks, reasons, and acts. It can:

🧠 Behave like a digital analyst that:

1. Ingests a 300-page loan packet


2. Autonomously identifies required documents (e.g., 1003, Closing Disclosure, 4506-C, FHA Addendum)


3. Checks for compliance rules (e.g., signature must be present, address must match credit report)


4. Triggers conditional logic:

“If property is FHA, check for HUD-92900-A form”

“If co-borrower exists, verify both signatures”



5. Writes findings in plain English, flags exceptions, and suggests corrective steps


6. Loops and refines based on new inputs — like a junior loan processor would

🔁 How Agentic IDP Improves Workflow:

Step	Manual Approach	Agentic AI

Document sorting	Manual classification	Auto classify, tag
Signature validation	Page-by-page check	Visual model checks presence & position
Rule compliance	Checklist lookup	Dynamic reasoning
Exception writing	Manual logging	AI-generated exception summary
Rerouting tasks	Manual reassignment	Agent triggers actions/tools



---

🧪 Example Output from Agentic AI:

Loan: #982342

🟠 Exception Summary:
- Closing Disclosure missing borrower's signature (Page 193)
- Address mismatch between 1003 and Credit Report
- 4506-C not found (required for self-employed income)

✅ Suggested Actions:
- Route to originator for re-sign
- Trigger address validation workflow
- Request missing form from customer portal
