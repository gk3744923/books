Proposed System Architecture Diagram
This diagram illustrates the core components and their interactions in a clear, sequential flow. The entire process functions as a feedback loop, with the Testing & Validation Agent continuously refining the output.

Detailed Workflow: A Phased Approach to Conversion
The conversion process is a structured journey, with each phase managed by a specialized AI agent.

Phase 1: Ingestion & Deep Analysis
Overview:
The process begins with the Orchestration Agent receiving the mainframe source code and project artifacts. It dispatches the task to the Code Analysis Agent.
Input:
- Mainframe artifacts (COBOL code, JCL scripts, DB2/VSAM schemas)
Code Analysis Agent Tasks:
- Performs static and dynamic analysis
- Parses legacy code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Generates a detailed dependency map
Artifacts Posted to Blackboard:
- AST
- dependency_map
- data_dictionary

Phase 2: Business Logic Extraction
Overview:
The Business Logic Extraction Agent retrieves the analyzed artifacts from the Blackboard.
Input:
- AST and dependency_map from the Blackboard
Business Logic Agent Tasks:
- Uses LLMs to infer and document core business rules in plain English
- Separates application functionality from implementation details
Artifacts Posted to Blackboard:
- business_logic_summary

Phase 3: Java Code Generation
Overview:
With business logic defined, the Java Code Generation Agent performs the core translation.
Input:
- business_logic_summary
- data_dictionary
Code Generation Agent Tasks:
- Translates business rules into idiomatic Java code
- Often uses Spring Boot framework
Artifacts Posted to Blackboard:
- generated_java_code

Phase 4: Transformation of Dependencies & APIs
Overview:
Two agents work in parallel to modernize the application's environment.
Input:
- dependency_map
- data_dictionary
Dependency Resolver Agent Tasks:
- Converts JCL and IMS DB schemas to modern equivalents (e.g., Kubernetes jobs, relational/NoSQL schemas)
Integration & API Generation Agent Tasks:
- Creates RESTful APIs to replace mainframe-specific protocols (e.g., CICS)
Artifacts Posted to Blackboard:
- modern_schemas
- migration_scripts
- api_definitions

Phase 5: Automated Testing & Validation
Overview:
This stage ensures fidelity and correctness of the conversion.
Input:
- generated_java_code
- Original mainframe test outputs
Testing & Validation Agent Tasks:
- Generates and executes automated tests
- Compares results with original outputs
- Flags discrepancies
Artifacts Posted to Blackboard:
- validation_report

Phase 6: Human-in-the-Loop Oversight
Overview:
A human expert monitors the entire process via a dashboard.
Input:
- All artifacts on the Blackboard, especially the validation_report
Human Expert Tasks:
- Reviews and approves agent outputs
- Provides corrections and guidance
- Ensures business continuity
Action:
- Expert feedback is used to restart the workflow at the appropriate phase
- Enables iterative refinement until full validation is achieved
